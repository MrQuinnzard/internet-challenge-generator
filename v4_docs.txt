--- v4.0, 1, 2, 3, 4.x ---

idea #1: building a shell around the main code that executes the generator as a function instead of a program
i'm codenaming it "casserole dish"
creating the file now
moving the license agreement
license agreement moved to shell, intro message converted to function
converting menu/generator to function
generator converted, making loop
loop can ony run up to 32 bit limit, which is slightly disappointing, but then again, who would run a dumb python program 2.14 billion times without closing?
loop is finished, testing now
multiple errors, had to re-import colorama and rename the dish to main.py
had to take the import code out of the generator and put it in the casserole dish
same w/ casserole
now i am just removing everything the shell does from the generator/casserole
FUCK
sorry about that, here's some context:
i got the loop and shit to work, but here's the problem: it only generates one title for each category every time the generator opens

idea #2: convert the functions themselves into loops
currently condensing every random.choice into a single loop that runs with the generator/casserole
deleting the copy of the lists inside of casserole and defining the values by importing the generator
casserole has been condensed, testing in progress
nvm, gotta condense the generator and import that to casserole
FUCK SHIT DAMMIT

idea #3: fuck it let's just turn casserole into a loop
taking the old casserole code and putting it back in

idea #4: loop exec()
almost everything is in order now, there is just one problem: exec() can't run the 
promble kinda fixed: had to reimport generator, I think I just have to exec just "generator" and not "generator.py"
error from v4.3.2 beta, casserole dish v2, line 24:
"TypeError: exec() arg 1 must be a string, bytes or code object"
tf does that mean??? xD
read a quick tutorial, i think i have to define generator.py as generator and exec that
no error lines under the code, hope this works
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAaaaaaaaAAAAAAaA FUCK

idea #5: LOOP. THE. PROGRAM.
indenting the entirety of casserole + the generator
casserole and the generator are now functions
no error lines, let's do this shit
wtf it's not generating, it's just repeating the continue message
just did a quick test, it is a problem with the intro/generator
whoops, forgot to un-function the intro
aight, v4.4.2 is about to be tested
whoops, forgot to unindent 
whoops, forgot to unindent the generator
whoops, formatting issues
ALRIGHT. v4.4.3 IS TESTING NOW.
YEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAHHHHH!!!!!
the generator kinda works, a few kinks need to be smoothed out (examples: version string, casserole not working, tiktok printing after youtube, no style reset, etc.)
the bug fixes will rollout in v4.5

--- version 4.5 alpha ---
it seems, under further investigation, that video game challenges and classic generation also print out fake disorder cringe
new bug: tiktok doesn't work
me when formatting issue -_-
casserole is a whole different promble, will be fixed in 4.5.1/casserole v2.21

--- casserole 2.21 ---
just had to move some stuff around

*ahem*
YES, I DID IT, I FINALLY DID IT!

--- 4.5.01 ---
minor qol change: screen now clears after looping + overflow error handler (as if we'd have an overflow error)

--- 4.5.2 ---
minor update, includes the following content:
- new items in the generators
- easter egg inside cringe flavor/casserole (warning, crashes the app)

--- v5.0.0 beta ---
repl is literally breaking down under the sheer weight of the generator
the teacher just said "penis"
added that to the generator
updated "Fortnite" in the beta generator to "Fortnite Chapter 3, which gives me a Tuesday deadline
added error handler for when both of the people in a yt kids title are the same, and added error codes to the handler(s)
error handler complete
i need to add a major feature to make this the 5.0 update

--- v5 RC ---
idea #1: add a randomly generated ad at the beginning
ad generator is a 5.0 feature, but will be rolled out before generator 5.0 in order to test it 

--- version 5.0.0 release ---
added in-dev features, can be accessed via the main menu with secret keywords
rolling out changes to the stable versions

--- version 6.0.0 beta ---
rolling out movie to stable via a beta menu
ad will stay hidden

--- version 5.1.1 ---
dug up v1 and added it
